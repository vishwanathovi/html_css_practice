			<p>Into the wild is a movie about a young guy who goes on a journey to Alaska after finishing his graduation. Questioning the imperfections of the society and the individuals in it, he thinks the best solution for his is to get away from the society and live in wild. Leaving his parents without any notice, meeting a hippie couple, living and working with a farmer and so on he continues his journey. A narrative showing a young idiolists perspective about the life, explores consequences of idiolist approch and provides vocals to the debate between the realist and idealist point of views. May be the people who have accepted the world as it is are right or the people who question the integrity of the way it works. Finally, it's the individual viewer that decides which side he is on.</p>
