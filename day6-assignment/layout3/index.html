					<div class="blocks section1-blocks">These two divs are positioned next to one another using <mark>display: inline-block</mark></div>
					<div class="blocks section1-blocks">Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset ensure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a button margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inine elements.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<div class="blocks section2-blocks">These two positioned using <mark>float: left</mark>.</div>
					<div class="blocks section2-blocks">you can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the same page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but..

				<div class="section">
					<div class="blocks section3-blocks">What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50% , right?</div>
					<div class="blocks section3-blocks"> Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will addd up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.

					<div class="blocks section4-blocks">If i do the same thing with floated elements... </div>
					<div class="blocks section4-blocks">The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the viewport.</div>
